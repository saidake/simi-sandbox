# Introduction
**Simi Sandbox** is a developer-friendly toolkit for remote server management â€” enabling file transfer, command execution, and automated dependency setup.

# Core Scripts
## [scripts/cpfiles.sh](./scripts/cpfiles.sh)
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)  
![](./docs/assets/scripts/cpfiles.svg)  
Automates uploading files from `ASSETS_ROOT` to mapped remote paths, according to 
rules in `PROPERTIES_FILE`.

Prerequisites:
  1. `sshpass` is installed locally.
  2. Make sure the current bash file has execution privileges: `chmod +x scripts/cpfiles.sh`
  3. Configure server variables in `scripts/AAA/config/server.sh`:
       - REMOTE_HOST
       - REMOTE_USER
       - REMOTE_SSH_PORT (default: 22)
       - REMOTE_PWD

Examples (run directly for easy start, using default settings):
  * `./scripts/cpfiles.sh`

      Copies `example1.txt` to the remote directory `~/examples`,
      and copies `example2.txt` and `example3.txt` from `scripts/AAA/assets/exampledir` 
      to the remote directory `~/examples/targetdir` on the test server.
  * `./scripts/cpfiles.sh ./scripts/AAA/assets/example-env.sh`

      Use the specified env configuration to copy `example2.txt` and `example3.txt` 
      from `scripts/AAA/assets/exampledir` to the remote directory
      `~/examples/targetdir2` on the test server.

Usage:
  * `./scripts/cpfiles.sh [<env.sh>]`

     You can define script options in a specified `env.sh` to override the default options in this script.

Script Options (variables in this script):
  * USE_RSYNC    : (true/false) Use `rsync` for uploading instead of `scp`.
  * USE_SUDO     : (true/false) If true, these commands will be executed with sudo privileges on the remote machine.
  * SILENT       : (true/false) If true, disables all overwrite confirmation prompts (auto-approve).
  * PROPERTIES_FILE   : Copies the folder contents or files corresponding to the keys in the properties file
      to the remote directories specified by the values.
  * ASSETS_ROOT       : The base directory where the relative paths (keys) from PROPERTIES_FILE are located.


Global Environment Variables:
  * ROOT : The absolute path of the scripts directory.

## [scripts/execr.sh](./scripts/execr.sh)
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)  
![](./docs/assets/scripts/execr.svg)  
This script executes a local bash file on the remote server.

Prerequisites:
  1. `sshpass` is installed locally.
  2. Make sure the current bash file has execution privileges: `chmod +x scripts/execr.sh`
  3. Configure variables in `scripts/AAA/config/server.sh`:
       - REMOTE_HOST
       - REMOTE_USER
       - REMOTE_SSH_PORT (default: 22)
       - REMOTE_PWD

Examples (run directly for easy start, using default settings):
  * `./scripts/execr.sh ./scripts/AAA/assets/example-bash.sh`

     Execute the bash file `./scripts/AAA/assets/example-bash.sh` on your remote server.

Usage:
  * `./scripts/exec.sh <local-bash-file-path>`

    The first parameter `<local-bash-file-path>` is a local Bash file, which will be
    executed directly on the remote server.

Script Options (variables in this script):
  * USE_RSYNC    : (true/false) Use 'rsync' for uploading instead of 'scp'.
  * USE_SUDO     : (true/false) If true, the bash script will be executed with sudo privileges on the remote machine.

      In sudo mode, the script is first copied to the remote server before execution.  
      In non-sudo mode, it is executed directly on the remote server via SSH.
  * SILENT       : (true/false) If true, disables all confirmation prompts (auto-approve).
  * LOCAL_BASH_FILE       : Local bash file to execute
  * REMOTE_TMP_BASH_FILE  : The local bash script will be uploaded to this path on the remote server.
  * REMOTE_WORK_PATH      : The working directory on the remote server where the script will be executed.
                           
Global Env:
  * ROOT : The absolute path of scripts directory.

## [scripts/patchr.sh](./scripts/patchr.sh)
[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)  
![](./docs/assets/scripts/patchr.svg)  
This script safely patches a remote file on a server using one of two modes:
  1. Upload a local file and replace a target remote file.
  2. Recover the original remote file from a backup.

Steps (in patch mode):
  1. Upload a local file (`LOCAL_FILE`) to a temporary location (`REMOTE_UPLOAD_FILE`) on the remote server.
  2. Backup the target remote file (`REMOTE_FILE`) to a backup path (`REMOTE_BACKUP_FILE`).
  3. Overwrite the remote target file (`REMOTE_FILE`) with the uploaded file.

Steps (in recover mode):
  1. Overwrite the current remote file (`REMOTE_FILE`) with the backup (`REMOTE_BACKUP_FILE`).

Prerequisites:
  1. `sshpass` is installed locally.
  2. Make sure the current bash file has execution privileges: `chmod +x scripts/patchr.sh`
  3. Configure variables in `scripts/AAA/config/server.sh`:
       - REMOTE_HOST
       - REMOTE_USER
       - REMOTE_SSH_PORT (default: 22)
       - REMOTE_PWD
  4. [Optional] Create a file `~/examples/example-patch-remote.txt` on your remote server for testing purposes.

Examples (run directly for easy start, using default settings):
  * `./scripts/patchr.sh`

       Patch remote file `~/examples/example-patch-remote.txt` with the local file `scripts/AAA/assets/example-patch.txt`
  * `./scripts/patchr.sh recover`

       Recover from backup

Usage:
  * `./scripts/patchr.sh`

       Patch remote file
  * `./scripts/patchr.sh recover`

       Recover from backup

Script Options (variables inside this script):
  * LOCAL_FILE         : Path to the local file that will be uploaded.
  * REMOTE_UPLOAD_FILE : Remote file path where the local file will be uploaded.
  * REMOTE_FILE        : The original remote file to be backed up before overwriting.
  * REMOTE_BACKUP_FILE : Path where the backup of REMOTE_FILE will be stored.

  * USE_RSYNC          : (true/false) If true, use 'rsync' for uploading; otherwise use 'scp'.
  * SILENT             : (true/false) If true, suppresses all confirmation prompts (auto-approve).
  * USE_SUDO           : (true/false) If true, these commands will be executed with sudo privileges on the remote machine.

Global Env:
  * ROOT : The absolute path of scripts directory.

# Environment Configuration Helper
## Docker and Docker Compose
Docker is a platform that enables you to package, distribute, and run applications in lightweight, portable containers. It ensures consistency across different environments.
Docker Compose is a tool that helps define and manage multi-container Docker applications using a simple YAML file, allowing you to easily configure and run multiple services together.
