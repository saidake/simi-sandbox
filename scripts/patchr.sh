# This script safely patches a remote file on a server using one of two modes:
#   1. Upload a local file and replace a target remote file.
#   2. Recover the original remote file from a backup.
#
# Steps (in patch mode):
#   1. Upload a local file (`LOCAL_FILE`) to a temporary location (`REMOTE_UPLOAD_FILE`) on the remote server.
#   2. Backup the target remote file (`REMOTE_FILE`) to a backup path (`REMOTE_BACKUP_FILE`).
#   3. Overwrite the remote target file (`REMOTE_FILE`) with the uploaded file.
#
# Steps (in recover mode):
#   1. Overwrite the current remote file (`REMOTE_FILE`) with the backup (`REMOTE_BACKUP_FILE`).
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. `sshpass` is installed locally.
#   2. Configure variables in `scripts/AAA/config/server.sh`:
#        - REMOTE_HOST
#        - REMOTE_USER
#        - REMOTE_SSH_PORT (default: 22)
#        - REMOTE_PWD
#   3. Create a file `~/examples/example-patch-remote.txt` on your remote server for testing purposes.
#
# Examples (run directly for easy start, using default settings):
#   * ./scripts/patchr.sh
#
#        Patch remote file `~/examples/example-patch-remote.txt` with the local file `scripts/AAA/assets/example-patch.txt`
#   * ./scripts/patchr.sh recover
#
#        Recover from backup
#
# Usage:
#   * ./scripts/patchr.sh
#
#        Patch remote file
#   * ./scripts/patchr.sh recover
#
#        Recover from backup
#
# Script Options (variables inside this script):
#   * LOCAL_FILE         : Path to the local file that will be uploaded.
#   * REMOTE_UPLOAD_FILE : Remote file path where the local file will be uploaded.
#   * REMOTE_FILE        : The original remote file to be backed up before overwriting.
#   * REMOTE_BACKUP_FILE : Path where the backup of REMOTE_FILE will be stored.

#   * USE_RSYNC          : (true/false) If true, use 'rsync' for uploading; otherwise use 'scp'.
#   * SILENT             : (true/false) If true, suppresses all confirmation prompts (auto-approve).
#
# Global Env:
#   * ROOT : The absolute path of scripts directory.
